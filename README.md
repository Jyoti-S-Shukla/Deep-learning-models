# Deep-learning-models
This repository consists of some deep learning models on dummy datasets. 
Starting from the genesis of model learning laws such as associative networks, hebbian learning and widrow's law, various other methods have been shown. Working of a simple MLP network to complex generative models such as GAN and RBM have been demonstrated. 

  1. Associative network, hebbian and widrow's law.ipynb: Autoassociation, hetero-association tasks are implemented on linearly independent, linearli dependent and orthonormal data. Weights are computed through computation, hebian process and widrow's learning law.
  2. Early models of DL.ipynb: Implemented McCulloch-Pits Neuron Model, Rosenblatt's Perceptron Model and Widrow's ADAline model for realization of logic gates and linear regression equation.
  3. Perceptron.ipynb: Demonstration of single layer, multi-layer perceptron to perform multiclass classification on dummy data.
  4. Neural network with backpropagation.ipynb: Demonstration of working of multilayer FFNN and the improvised multi-layered neural network with backpropagation on non-linearly separable and non-convex datasets. Activation functions and vanishing/ exploding gradient descent problem addressed.
  5. CNN.ipynb: The convolutional neural network and its benefit over simple NN were demonstrated for a image recognition task. Pooling,  translation invariance of the pooling layer and the dropout layer were also visualized. 
  6. Image classification using CNN.ipynb: Image classification on MNIST data was performed from scratch. 
  7. RNN.ipynb: Recurrent neural network model was implemented from scratch to handle temporal data series.
  8. Autoencoders.ipynb: Simple working of autoencoder was demonstrated. Different types of autoencoder such as denoising AE, Sparse and contractive encoder with different kinds of regularization techniques were demonstrated. 
  9. Transformers.ipynb: A transformer model was built using the self-attention blocks. Senitment analysis and movie rating applications were then implemented from the designed transformer block. 
  10. RBM.ipynb: Restricted Boltzmann Machine model was implemented alongwith logistic regression to perform classification task.
  11. GAN.ipynb: Generative Adversarial Networks which are also a kind of generative models are implemented on MNIST Digit Dataset.
